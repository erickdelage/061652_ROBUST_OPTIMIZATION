title: Course Project
---

The project will consist of a numerical analysis of the performance of a robust optimization model designed to address a specific management problem. 
The specific nature of the problem may be proposed by the student or could consist of replicating the numerical results described in a recent scientific paper. 
Each student will need to submit a one page project proposal before the last day of the course

Generally speaking, the final project report should be 10-12 pages long and discuss the following:
- Presentation of the decision problem in its deterministic form
- Motivation regarding the key uncertainties in this problem
- Presentation of a robust optimization model
- Description of the solution scheme
- Presentation of experimental setup
- Summary of numerical findings

Due date of proposal: March 8th, 2024  
Due date for report: May 8th, 2024
