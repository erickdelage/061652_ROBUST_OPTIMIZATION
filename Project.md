title: Course Project
---

The project will consist of a numerical analysis of the performance of a robust optimization model designed to address a specific management problem. 
The specific nature of the problem may be proposed by the student or could consist of replicating the numerical results described in a recent scientific paper. 
Each student will present their work in a 10-12 pages report.

Generally speaking, the report and presentation should discuss the following:
- Presentation of the decision problem in its deterministic form
- Motivation regarding the key uncertainties in this problem
- Presentation of a robust optimization model
- Description of the solution scheme (either through reformulation or decomposition methods)
- Presentation of experimental setup
- Summary of numerical findings
