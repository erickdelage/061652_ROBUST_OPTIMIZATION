Welcome to the website for **"061652 Robust Optimization"** offered at Politecnico di Milano from February 27th to March 8th, 2024.

# Introduction

Celebrating 20 years of renewed and flourishing interest in the robust optimization paradigm, this course will introduces students to the it is of hedging risks in large managerial decision problems where distributions assumptions can made. More specifically, the students will be with the main tools that are used in the application of the robust optimization paradigm: convex theory (duality theory, saddle point theorem, Karush-Kuhn-Tucker conditions), data-driven uncertaintyset design, decision decision manipulation, tractable reformulation and decomposition algorithms for problems of infinite size. In addition, the course will cover a set of practical applications where the use of such tools is called-for. Applications will be inspired from a diversified range of fields of such practice as logistics, finance, marketing, etc.

At the end of the course, the students should be able to:
- recognize a business management or engineering situation presenting at robust optimization problem,
- represent this problem under a mathematical suitable model,
- exploit available historical observations to adequately characterize the uncertainty
- identify robust solutions using cutting edge software and algorithms.

# Course Material

The course will be based on a my lecture notes which can be found ([here](./LectureNotes_v15.pdf)).

# Software

We will implement robust optimization using the [RSOME](https://xiongpengnus.github.io/rsome/about) package in Python in the Google Colab environment. In order to prepare for the course, please make sure that you are able to run the following example: [Google Colab link](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/11N9LmKGqxn71tI-PjQ_GpUkthzbTax_E?usp=sharing).
